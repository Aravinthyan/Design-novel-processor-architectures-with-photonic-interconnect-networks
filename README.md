# Design-novel-processor-architectures-with-photonic-interconnect-networks
The project will focus on novel high capacity photonic interconnect networks
for high performance computing (HPC). HPC’s are used for more complex
computational tasks such as drug discovery or climate modelling.[1] There
have been people who have looked into this using photonic interconnect
networks however, there were certain challenges.[2] One of these challenges
being large bandwidth of Tbps for each port.[2] This project will involve the
initial design and implementation of subcomponents of a HPC using a pho-
tonic interconnect network, although due to time constraints, a simulation
of the network will be tested, rather than a physical implementation. How-
ever, the work will involve a microprocessor architecture being specified and
it’s microarchitecture designed and implemented in System Verilog. This
architecture will include circuits for control and information transmission
over the photonic network which will utilise wavelength and space division
multiplexing. The processor will be tested on a (Field Programmable Gate
Array) FPGA to confirm it works as designed. The operation of multiple
such processors interconnected with the (Wavelength-Space Division Mul-
tiplexing) WSDM interconnect network with a ring topology will be simu-
lated in MATLAB. The simulation uses statistically generated data traffic
patterns.
