# Design novel processor architectures with photonic interconnect networks
Data traffic has been exponentially increasing within data centres and high performance computers over the years. In order to accommodate future traffic growth, alternative technologies need to be investigated, as the currently-used electronic packet switching approaches lead to bottlenecks constricting network throughput. Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) and space division multiplexing (SDM) are two complementary optical technologies to increase link throughputs. Using wavelength and space domains to route signals optically between nodes also offers high flexibility and throughput and low latencies, avoiding the constrictions of electronic packet switched networks. This report describes the specification, design, implementation and testing of a novel microprocessor design, designed to carry out compute operations and communicate and exchange data with a large number of other such compute nodes (on the order of thousands of nodes). The interconnect network considered was a high capacity optical broadcast-and-select interconnect network with a simple ring topology, based on combined WDM and SDM technologies. The microarchitecture of the microprocessor was developed in SystemVerilog and verified using ModelSim. Parts of the microprocessor were experimentally implemented and tested using a field programmable gate array (FPGA). All the simulation and experimental results were successful.
